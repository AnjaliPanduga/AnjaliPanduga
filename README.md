## 📊 Projects

### Student Marks Prediction Using Machine Learning & Flask

- Developed a Machine Learning regression model to predict student marks based on daily study hours.
- Trained and evaluated the model using Scikit-Learn, achieving reliable predictions for unseen inputs.
- Built a Flask-based web application to deploy the trained model and enable real-time user interaction.
- Implemented input validation to ensure realistic study hour values (1–24 hours).
- Stored prediction results dynamically in a CSV file for further analysis.
- Demonstrated an end-to-end ML workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.

### Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

- Built a machine learning classification model to predict customer churn for business retention analysis.
- Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and improve model performance.
- Applied and evaluated multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify the best-performing model.
- Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for model evaluation and selection.
- Visualized data patterns and model results using Matplotlib and Seaborn for actionable insights.
- Deployed the model concept in a structured data science workflow, demonstrating skills in prediction and interpretability.
